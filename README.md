## How It Works  

Blob Questor runs on a **set schedule** to pull data from Azure and transport it securely to AWS:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Function App** runs **hourly**, executing a PowerShell script that queries Azure's resources and saves the results in a Blob file.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **CloudWatch Events** triggers an AWS Lambda function **twice a day** to initiate data transfer.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Lambda** authenticates with **Secrets Manager** to retrieve the Azure Storage Account Key.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Using the retrieved key, **Lambda gains access** to the Azure Blob storage container.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Lambda temporarily stores** the Blob file in **/tmp**, then **uploads it to S3**‚Äîsecuring it for further processing.  

**Why It‚Äôs Awesome**  
‚úî **Fully Automated** ‚Äì No manual intervention needed  
‚úî **Multi-Cloud Ready** ‚Äì Works across Azure & AWS  
‚úî **Secure & Scalable** ‚Äì Uses encrypted credentials and cloud-native services
